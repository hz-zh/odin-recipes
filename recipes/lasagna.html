   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
     <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Method</h2>
   <ol>
      <li><strong>Put pasta water on to boil</strong><br>
         Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for 
         every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. 
         It can take a while for a large pot of water to come 
         to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare 
         the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
      <li><strong>Brown the ground beef</strong><br>
         In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium 
         high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly 
         browned on all sides. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon 
         to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</strong><br>
         Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the 
         photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
         Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent 
         and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
         Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, 
         reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
   </ol>
